            <p>My amazing luck allowed me to grab these up at retail price for 110$ and was easily able to sell that on the lower end for 185$ + shipping. This shoe couldv've easily sold for something in the 200's but I wanted to get rid of them quickly as I saw the resell price looking like it was gonna go down. The amount produced of these was a lot and hype was mediocure.</p>
